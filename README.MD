# PlexRenamer Electron Version
Plex renamer is now on Electron. Completly changing the language from C# To JavaScript. The benefit of this being that the program now works on Windows and Linux. This will be in it's own repo as it is rewritten in a new language. The C# Version can be found [here](https://github.com/jacob9423/Plex-Renamer). But it won't be updated anymore.

A program that will take a directory of video files and then name them in Plex format

This is my project to rename video files (and subtitle files) into plex format.

I was getting tired of renaming all of the files tha I was putting on my plex server. Renaming 20 50 or even 100 files isn't fun.

So started this project and it's come a long way. 

The program will let you select the directory that the files are in. Have you type in the name of the show, and allow you to select if
they are subtitle files. Also the Check button only takes the files that are in the directory and display them to you. I did this for
testing but kept it in.

Formating Examples: 

Videos:

Example - s01e01.mp4

Subtitles:

Example - s01e01.eng.ass

When renaming subtitle files eng is the default language so if you type nothing into it it will automaticly default to english.
